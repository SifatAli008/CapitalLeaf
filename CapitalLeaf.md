## **CapitalLeaf: Dynamic Vector Defense with Microservice Isolation, Behavior-Driven Protection & Live Threat Intelligence.**

---

### **1\. Background & Motivation**

Financial platforms face rising cyber threats like lateral attacks, data theft, and rapidly evolving vulnerabilities often beyond the reach of traditional security measures.

For example, in 2025, Iran’s Bank Sepah was hit by a cyberattack where hackers stole 42 million customer records and demanded a $42 million ransom—highlighting risks of lateral movement and massive data exfiltration. Similarly, an insider-driven breach at Coinbase exposed sensitive customer data of nearly 70,000 users via bribed third-party agents, illustrating the danger of unauthorized data access and insider threats.

The rise in accessible computing information has made it easier to learn—and easier for malicious actors to find and exploit company vulnerabilities online. 

In 2025, Iran’s Bank Sepah was breached, with 42 million records stolen and a $42M ransom demanded, showcasing the threat of lateral attacks and data exfiltration. Similarly, a Coinbase insider breach exposed data of 70,000 users, highlighting insider risks. 

These incidents show that financial platforms face cyber threats like lateral attacks, data theft, and rapidly evolving vulnerabilities that often surpass the traditional security defenses.

\*/

CapitalLeaf specifically counters these challenges by:

* **Microservice Network Segmentation** to block lateral attacker movement between services, limiting breach impact.

* **Behavior-Driven Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** to detect and block unauthorized transmission of sensitive financial data based on abnormal user and system behaviors.

* **Real-Time Threat Intelligence** for immediate detection and response to emerging threats, reducing exposure time.

This precise, intelligence-driven defense framework safeguards sensitive financial assets and customer information while ensuring efficiency and operational trustworthiness in a high-risk environment.

### **2\. Goals and Objectives**

* Design and develop a multi-phase cybersecurity framework tailored for financial platforms.  
    
* Integrate preventive, detective, and responsive controls such as Behavior-Driven Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Real-Time Threat Intelligence throughout the data lifecycle.  
    
* Minimize attack surfaces by implementing Microservice Network Segmentation and adaptive access management.  
    
* Showcase enhanced platform security through modular, scalable features focused on practical, behavior-driven defense mechanisms.

###  **3\. Comparative Review of Prior Studies**

Recent studies often address isolated security threats in financial platforms, such as phishing or data leakage, resulting in partial protection:

* **Traditional IDS (e.g., Snort-based)** rely on signature and pattern matching, struggling with zero-day attacks and lacking behavior context.

* **Financial Firewalls** focus primarily on network-layer security but miss insider threats and application-level anomalies.

* **Single-phase DLP systems** depend on keyword blocking, which can be bypassed through obfuscation or encrypted channels.

In contrast, our platform adopts a **multi-vector defense model** across infiltration, propagation, aggregation, and exfiltration stages. This includes:

* **Context-aware, behavior-driven policies** that adjust dynamically to emerging threats.

* **Cross-layer protection** combining network segmentation, anomaly detection, and decoy-based strategies.

* **Real-time reaction to threat behavior** rather than static rule enforcement.

### **4\. Selected Features and Functionalities**

The platform integrates targeted features under four core threat categories:

#### **Infiltration**

* **Zero Trust Access Control**  
   Continuously verifies users using behavioral, device, and contextual metrics.

* **AI-Driven Intrusion Detection**  
   Monitors login and access patterns to flag anomalous behaviors and compromised accounts.

* **Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Enforces dynamic MFA requirements when risk scores rise

#### **Propagation**

* **Microservice Isolation via Network Policies**  
   Prevents lateral movement of threats across service boundaries.

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**  
   Detects unauthorized script or file changes across the infrastructure.  
    
* **Service-to-Service Behavior Analytics** – Identifies abnormal communication flows between microservices to catch compromised workloads early.

####  **Aggregation**

* **Role-Based Access to Data Vaults**  
   Protects financial records and customer data with strict role-based permissions.

* **Secure Data Pipelines with Audit Trails**  
   Ensures that only validated, encrypted data flows into analytics or dashboards.

#### **Exfiltration**

* **Behavior-Aware DLP Engine**  
   Blocks transmission of financial keywords, identifiers, or behavioral anomalies.

* **Honeytokens and Decoy Records**  
   Plants fake data to detect and trap exfiltration attempts before real damage occurs.
