# CapitalLeaf 🛡️

**Dynamic Defense with Microservice Isolation, Behavior-Driven Protection & Live Threat Intelligence**

A comprehensive cybersecurity framework designed specifically for financial platforms to protect against lateral attacks, data theft, and rapidly evolving vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Security Components

- **🔐 Zero Trust Access Control** - Continuous user verification using behavioral, device, and contextual metrics
- **🤖 AI-Driven Intrusion Detection** - Monitors login and access patterns to flag anomalous behaviors
- **🏗️ Microservice Network Segmentation** - Prevents lateral movement of threats across service boundaries
- **📊 Behavior-Driven Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** - Detects and blocks unauthorized transmission of sensitive data
- **🎯 Real-Time Threat Intelligence** - Immediate detection and response to emerging threats

### Threat Categories Covered

1. **Infiltration** - Zero Trust Access Control, AI-Driven Intrusion Detection, Adaptive MFA
2. **Propagation** - Microservice Isolation, File Integrity Monitoring, Service-to-Service Analytics
3. **Aggregation** - Role-Based Access to Data Vaults, Secure Data Pipelines with Audit Trails
4. **Exfiltration** - Behavior-Aware DLP Engine, Honeytokens and Decoy Records

## 📋 Prerequisites
